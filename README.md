# File-compressor
I build my own version of a file compressor.  Not a new algorithm, but my own code.

## Small explanation
I choosed `Run-Length Encoding` because it seemed the easiest.
(Here would be the part were Run-Length Encoding gets explained. Some day...)

## ToDo's
- [x] Make it work
- [ ] Build parts of the program in C (for more speed and maybe even realtime de- and encoding)
